        <h2>What is Starknet?</h2>
        <p>
            Starknet is a Validity Rollup Layer 2. It provides high throughput, low gas costs, and retains Ethereum Layer 1 levels of security. Imagine it as a way to make Ethereum faster, cheaper, and just as secure.
        </p>
        <p>Starknet operates on the principle that verifying a solution is easier than solving a problem from scratch. Think of it like a Sudoku puzzle. When someone solves it, others can verify the solution without redoing all the work. This strategy reduces redundancy and makes the network more efficient.</p>
        <p>In simpler terms, Starknet scales Ethereum by shifting heavy L1 computations to lighter L1 verification using STARK proofs computed off-chain.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
            Let's break down the complex jargon. Starknet is like a high-tech engine running behind the scenes, making Ethereum faster and more secure.
        </p>
        <p>Starknet is a permissionless Validity-Rollup, often called a “ZK-Rollup,” that acts as a Layer 2 (L2) network over Ethereum. It operates in the real world, not just in theory. It achieves the same level of security as Ethereum Layer 1 by using the strongest cryptographic proof system called STARK.</p>
        <p>Now, you might wonder what STARK is. In simple terms, it's a set of mathematical tricks that make the entire system work securely and efficiently. Think of it as the secret sauce that makes Starknet possible.</p>
        <p>Starknet contracts are mostly written in the Cairo language, which is like the programming language for this magic engine. It's designed to make STARK proofs, which are the mathematical evidence that everything is working as it should.</p>
        <p>In essence, Starknet solves two critical blockchain issues: scalability and privacy. It invites everyone to verify transactions, ensuring inclusive accountability. And it does this without compromising your privacy or excluding anyone due to computational limits.</p>

        <h2>Glossary</h2>
        <p>
            This glossary provides explanations for key Starknet concepts and terms, helping you navigate the world of Starknet with confidence. Even if you're not a blockchain expert, you'll find this glossary user-friendly.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Application Developers</h3>
        <p>
            These are the builders of Starknet applications. They create and deploy both Starknet and Ethereum contracts.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Blocks (previously known as batches)</h3>
        <p>
            Blocks are like organized bundles of Starknet transactions processed by the Starknet OS. They result in one combined state change recorded in the Starknet L1 core contract. A block comes with a unique identifier (block hash) for easy reference and an ordinal number (block number) indicating its position in the sequence of accepted blocks. Note that a block's number may change over time, especially during L1 chain re-orders.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Full State Node</h3>
        <p>
            A Full State Node is your go-to source for querying the current Starknet state. It can independently answer questions about the Starknet network's present condition, including the L1 state. It doesn't deal with transaction batches; its focus is on providing real-time answers.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Prover</h3>
        <p>
            The Prover is a separate process that receives output from Cairo programs and crafts STARK proofs for verification. These STARK proofs are then submitted to the verifier, which registers the evidence on L1, ensuring transparency and trust.

        <h2>Getting Started Using Starknet</h2>
        <p>
            A gentle hand-holding guide for your first steps using Starknet.
        </p>
        <p>Background: When I tried to get started using Starknet, I found it difficult to know exactly what to do. While I’ve heard a lot about the wonders of Starknet and how it can save me money in fees while providing security and trustlessness, I’m a blockchain newbie. In my quest to onboard to Starknet and try out some of the applications in the ecosystem, I found a lot of helpful information, but I also didn’t find a lot of information.</p>

        <h2>Overview Docs</h2>
        <p>
            Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized zero-knowledge rollup (ZK rollup) for Ethereum. It operates as a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation without compromising on Ethereum’s composability and security.
